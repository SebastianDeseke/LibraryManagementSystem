# Library Management System
Welcome to my fun little project in *C#*

## Description

This project is a System with which to manage the ongoing task normally found in a __Library__. It can be scalled down for a single person use (yes some of us still read books). It is intended to be modular and have *API compatibility*. I am trying to make it accessable for frontend via API, but this field is a little unfamiliar to me. 

## Installation

## Usage

```csharp
Console.WriteLine ("Hello lovely world!");
```
